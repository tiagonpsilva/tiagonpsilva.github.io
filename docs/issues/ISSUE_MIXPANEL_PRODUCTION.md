# GitHub Issue: Mixpanel Analytics Not Collecting Metrics in Production

## Issue Title
Mixpanel Analytics Not Collecting Metrics in Production Environment

## Labels
- bug
- analytics
- production
- mixpanel

## Description

### Problem Description
Mixpanel analytics is not collecting metrics in the production environment at `https://tiagopinto.io` and `https://tiagopintoio.vercel.app`. The analytics system appears to be configured but events are not being tracked or sent to Mixpanel dashboard.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Visit production site: `https://tiagopintoio.vercel.app`
2. Navigate through different pages (should trigger page view events)
3. Interact with navigation, projects, contact methods
4. Wait for modal authentication to appear (30s or 3 page views)
5. Check Mixpanel dashboard for events
6. No events are recorded

### Expected Behavior
- Page view events should be tracked automatically
- Navigation interactions should be logged
- Project clicks should be recorded
- Contact method interactions should be tracked
- Authentication modal triggers should be monitored
- All events should appear in Mixpanel dashboard with proper properties

### Environment
- Platform: Vercel Production
- URL: https://tiagopintoio.vercel.app
- Mixpanel Integration: MixpanelContext + custom hooks
- Environment Variables: Set in Vercel Dashboard

### Investigation

**Environment Variables Status:**
Need to verify in Vercel Dashboard:
- `VITE_MIXPANEL_TOKEN` - Production token
- Environment separation working correctly

**Browser Console Check:**
```javascript
// Test in production console:
console.log('Mixpanel Check:', {
  hasMixpanel: !!window.mixpanel,
  token: import.meta?.env?.VITE_MIXPANEL_TOKEN?.substring(0, 8) + '...',
  environment: import.meta?.env?.NODE_ENV
});
```

**Implementation Files:**
- `/src/contexts/MixpanelContext.tsx` - Main analytics context
- `/src/hooks/useRouteTracking.tsx` - Automatic page tracking
- `/src/utils/mixpanelConfig.ts` - Environment configuration

### Potential Causes
1. **Environment Variables Missing**: `VITE_MIXPANEL_TOKEN` not set in Vercel
2. **Environment Detection Issue**: Development vs production detection failing
3. **Mixpanel Initialization**: Token not being passed correctly
4. **Build Process**: Environment variables not being included in build
5. **Network Issues**: Mixpanel requests being blocked
6. **Debug Mode**: Analytics disabled in certain environments

### Solution Investigation Steps
1. **Environment Variables Check**:
   - Verify `VITE_MIXPANEL_TOKEN` is set in Vercel Dashboard
   - Confirm token is valid Mixpanel project token
   - Test token in Mixpanel dashboard

2. **Browser Testing**:
   - Check browser console for Mixpanel initialization logs
   - Verify network requests to Mixpanel API
   - Test manual event tracking

3. **Code Review**:
   - Verify MixpanelContext initialization
   - Check environment detection logic
   - Confirm useRouteTracking is properly connected

### Files to Investigate
- `/src/contexts/MixpanelContext.tsx:15-40` - Initialization logic
- `/src/utils/mixpanelConfig.ts` - Environment configuration
- `/src/App.tsx:66-77` - MixpanelProvider integration
- `vercel.json` - Build configuration
- Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard

### Related Issues
- DNS configuration working (separate issue)
- LinkedIn OAuth integration (separate issue)

### Priority
High - Analytics are critical for understanding user behavior and optimizing conversions.

**Next Steps:**
1. Verify environment variables in Vercel
2. Test browser console in production
3. Review environment detection logic
4. Test manual Mixpanel events
5. Fix configuration and verify tracking
